## About Me

I am currently a PhD student at Laboratory of AstroDynamics, Tsinghua University, and also a visiting student at Lunar & Planetary Laboratory, University of Arizona. My [research](https://jiaoyf-thu.github.io/research/) interests are focused on asteroid exploration and deflection dynamics, as well as the collisional and dynamical evolution of small planetary bodies in the solar system. I am also engaged in the exploration of numerical simulations and optimization algorithms in planetary science.
