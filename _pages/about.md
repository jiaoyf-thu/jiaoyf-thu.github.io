I am currently a PhD student at Laboratory of AstroDynamics, Tsinghua University, and also a visiting student at Lunar \& Planetary Laboratory, University of Arizona. My research interests are focused on \textbf{asteroid exploration \& deflection dynamics}, as well as \textbf{the collisional \& dynamical evolution of small planetary bodies} in the solar system. I am also engaged in the exploration of numerical simulations and optimization algorithms in planetary science.
