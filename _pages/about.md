I am currently a PhD student at Laboratory of AstroDynamics, [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), and also a visiting student at [Lunar \& Planetary Laboratory, University of Arizona](https://www.lpl.arizona.edu/). My research interests are focused on \textbf{asteroid exploration \& deflection dynamics}, as well as \textbf{the collisional \& dynamical evolution of small planetary bodies} in the solar system. I am also engaged in the exploration of numerical simulations and optimization algorithms in planetary science.
