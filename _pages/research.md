### <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-024-02258-z" target="_blank">Earth's quasi-moon as a piece of lunar impact debris</a>

In this work, we use numerical simulations to demonstrate that asteroid 2016HO3's physical and orbital properties are compatible with a fragment from a crater larger than 10–20 km formed on the Moon in the last few million years. The impact could have ejected sufficiently large fragments into heliocentric orbits, some of which could be transferred to Earth 1:1 resonance and persist today. This leads us to suggest the young lunar crater Giordano Bruno (22 km diameter, 1-10 Myr age) as the most likely source.

### <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stad3888" target="_blank">SPH-DEM method modelling impacts on rubble-pile asteroids</a>

A new hybrid SPH–DEM framework is introduced to model the multistage dynamics involving shock propagation and gravitational re-accumulation in rubble-pile impacts, employing the surface contact particles and the interior gravity particles to describe large irregular boulders during long-term evolution. With the proposed method, the complexity of contact computation is reduced from O(N) to $O(N^{2/3})$⁠, and the gravity computation is accelerated by 100 times while maintaining the same level of resolution. The method is then used to simulate the DART impact on the rubble-pile asteroid Dimorphos.
